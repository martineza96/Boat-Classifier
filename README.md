# Boat-Classifier

While I was enlisted in the Navy , my job involved harbor secuirty operations. We had two main responsibilities. Escort submarines in and out of the port and identify and classify vessels in the area of responsibility. I had always wondered if the second part of the job could be done with machine learning. However, now that I am a Data Scientist, I decided to try to create a machine learning model that could classify common ships and boats that I would see evry day.
